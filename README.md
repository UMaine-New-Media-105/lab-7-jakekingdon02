Jake Kingdon 
README for Lab 7/

For assigment 1, I Created a sketch that uses circles that diagonally stretch across the canvas from the top-left to the bottom-right and then from the top-right to the bottom-left, making an "X" shape.

For assigment 2, I Created a sketch that uses circles to draw a grid of 5 by 5 shapes, with gradients and nested loops applied. Also, I used the position map functions to specify the gradient colors. 

I ran out of time to do assigment 3 so i wasnt able to make my sketch more interative.
